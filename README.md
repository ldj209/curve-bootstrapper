# Swap Curve Bootstrapper

This is a simple curve bootstrapper that was built a couple of years ago to illustrate the mechanics of curve building. It can replicate discount factors from market data providers quite closely but should not be used for financial decision making since it's purely for illustration purposes.

It was not developed with OIS stripping in mind but could be easily extended to allow for a multi-curve framework. Please refer to the notebook for usage.
